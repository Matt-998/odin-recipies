    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korvapuustit, or Cinnamon Buns are a Finnish delicacy. Made from <strong>pulla</strong>, a sweet, cardamom enriched bread with a cinnamon, sugar and butter filling, korvapuustit are often enjoyed with coffee or tea and are even celebrated on <em>National Cinnamon Bun Day</em> on the 4th of October in Finland and Sweden.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>50g fresh yeast or 2 packets dry yeast</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>200ml sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons cardamom</li>
        <li>Approx. 1600ml flour</li>
        <li>150g - 200g butter</li>
        <li>pearl sugar, to sprinkle on top</li>
        <li>1 extra egg for glazing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g butter</li>
        <li>100ml sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Incorporate the yeast into the lukewarm milk, then add 2 eggs, sugar, cardamom, salt and approx. 400-500ml of flour, mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the flour slowly while kneeding until the dough no longer sticks to your hands as much, or the bowl.</li>
        <li>Kneed in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a towel and set aside in a warm spot until it roughly doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out into 2 rectangular sheets and spread the softened butter evenly over them. Then sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar.</li>
        <li>Tightly roll the sheets up starting from the bottom and leave the seam face down. Then cut along the rolls in a zig-zag pattern to form many even triangles. To shape the triangles, face the pointed side upwards and squish them down a bit with a finger. Cover with a towel and leave to raise for approx. 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Glaze the dough with egg and sprinkle pearl sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for approx. 8 minutes at 225 celcius</li>
    </ol>
